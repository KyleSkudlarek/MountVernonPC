				<h1>Virus and Malware Removal</h1>
				<p> Viruses, spyware, malware, trojans etc. are harmful programs that infect your computer
				to steal personal data, spam you with unwanted ads and spread themselves to other computers. 
				These viruses often disguise themselves as legitimate looking antivirus programs and can be 
				very hard to detect and remove. </p>
				<h1>Hardware Diagnostics and Repair</h1>
				<p> Poor computer performance is sometimes due to the actual malfunctioning of the hardware itself.
				If your computer is constantly running slowly, shutting down randomly, and in general not
				behaving as it should, defective hardware may be the cause.
				<h1>Tune Up</h1>
				<p> Over time your computer fills up with unwanted downloads, add-ons, temporary system files, bloatware
				as you use it from day to day. Without regular cleaning and maintenance computer performance tends to be
				negatively affected by the build up of "clutter"
				<h1>Upgrade </h1>
				<p> Instead of buying a brand new computer, performance can be dramatically increased with the installation 
				of only one or two specific parts. Don't pay local companies' huge upcharge on computer hardware. 
				You will pay at cost for superior quality hardware and will only be charged for the time it takes
				to install</p>
				<h1>Windows Install</h1>
				<p> A fresh Windows install is a complicated and harrowing process, if you don't choose the right settings your 
				computer will be more at risk to infection and poor performance as you continue to use it. I have gone through 
				the process dozens of times and can ensure that your OS will be installed optimally.
				<h1>Custom Build and Consultation</h1>
				<p> If you are looking to buy a brand new computer you can often build one more cheaply and with superior quality
				parts then what is offered at "big box" retailers. I can help with anything computer related from home network setup
				to printer installation. Don't hesitate to call!
